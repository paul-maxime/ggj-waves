# Happy Wave Attack 2

You are the biggest tsunami you've ever seen. Using the power of the space bar, you can kill as many humans as you want. The more people you kill, the longer your wave can survive.

Some womans will try to stop you using hair dryers, without much success. However, the army will send fans to stop you and you will have to avoid them if you want to carry on.

Can you find the only way to win?
